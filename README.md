## Detailed Project Description:
In this project, as part of my data analyst training, I worked with Lapage, a company that transitioned from a physical bookstore to an online sales platform. My mission was to analyze sales indicators and customer behavior to help the marketing team assess business performance and make strategic decisions.

### Key Tasks and Objectives:

1. Sales Analysis:

    - Conduct an analysis of key sales indicators as requested by the business team.

    - Generate reports on sales metrics, revenue trends, and product performance using Python.
   
    - Provide visualizations of key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess sales effectiveness.
   
2. Customer Behavior Analysis:

    - Work closely with the team to analyze customer behavior on the online platform and compare it to data from physical stores.
   
    - Identify trends in customer purchases, demographics, and preferences to offer strategic insights.
   
3. Statistical Testing and Correlations:

    - Perform statistical tests and bivariate analyses to explore relationships between variables such as product pricing, sales volume, and customer segmentation.
      
    - Generate time series analysis to evaluate sales trends over specific periods.
      
4. Reporting and Presentation:

    -  Present the results in a professional report or notebook, with detailed insights and recommendations based on the analyses.
    -  Create a presentation for the management team to highlight key findings and support future decision-making.
  
By completing this project, I provided Lapage with valuable insights into their sales performance and customer behavior, helping them optimize their online strategy.
